## Description


this is the simplest example you can find about JWT with nestjs, my intention was to create an example simple enough for anyone just starting out to understand how to integrate JWT.

My intention is to provide a simple code, since the few articles I got are difficult to follow or the code is very integrated to the use of mongoDB, which might not be of interest to you. 

It's not a focused code for production, it doesn't use db, it doesn't even include DAO, I tried to simplify it so that once you understand this you can adapt it to any environment.


## Installation
